With nearly a decade of experience in software engineering, I have worked as an
individual contributor at companies like Shopify and led successful teams like
at TaxJar, which culminated in an acquisition by Stripe. Technically, I
specialize in the Ruby on Rails ecosystem and enjoy experimenting with new
technologies. In terms of leadership, I excel in fostering remote cultures,
building team camaraderie, driving impactful results, and providing technical
guidance.
